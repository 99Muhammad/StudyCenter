- course deletion issue
- the edit needed in grading system after implement the quiz 
- certificate of completion: where should I create it? in calculate grade it should generate a certificate of completion if he is pass.  
- maybe there is no need for calculate average grade, the average method could be called as delegate
 in adding grade in student assignment model. 
- check quiz routes 
- Grade page


- routes to test:  
-- calculate the average grade 
 


- for alzoubi 
-- Teacher buton for calculate avergae; does it check if the due date pass before continue in the 
process? (it should be)

-- check on routes, look which one need to return the Id and if anything messing
